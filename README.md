# Moddy Weapon, formerly Teardown-Weapon-Base

Inspired by https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2528866455
I wanted to challenge myself to making a gun base in Teardown

But not to just make another weapon base, I decided to allow the player to modify the included weapons. But also allow them to create their own weapons.

Currently not all internals are available for customization, mainly sound and particles. But that is planned to change.
